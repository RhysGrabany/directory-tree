# Directory Tree Generator

Drawing inspiration from DirTreeX, this command line utility program for Linux systems aims  
to print files and directories to the terminal.
Different colours are used to differentiate between files and folders in the system.  

Run the program, supply a root location, and provide the option of printing to file with  -o.  Outfile is saved as "output.txt".
